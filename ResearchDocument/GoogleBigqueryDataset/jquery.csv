<p>If you want to completely override the sorting by start date (allDaySlot &amp; month &amp; basics views).
For example to sort them by color.</p>

<p>1.Initialise <a href=""http://fullcalendar.io/docs/event_rendering/eventOrder/"" rel=""nofollow"">eventOrder</a> to color.</p>

<p>eventOrder: 'color,start'</p>

<p>2.Change the compareSegs function.</p>

<pre><code>// original function
compareSegs: function(seg1, seg2) {
    return seg1.eventStartMS - seg2.eventStartMS || // earlier events go first
        seg2.eventDurationMS - seg1.eventDurationMS || // tie? longer events go first
        seg2.event.allDay - seg1.event.allDay || // tie? put all-day events first (booleans cast to 0/1)
        compareByFieldSpecs(seg1.event, seg2.event, this.view.eventOrderSpecs);
}

// custom function
compareSegs: function(seg1, seg2) {
    if(this.view.name==""basicWeek""){ // ordering events by color in ListView
    return seg2.event.allDay - seg1.event.allDay || // tie? put all-day events first (booleans cast to 0/1)
        compareByFieldSpecs(seg1.event, seg2.event, this.view.eventOrderSpecs);
    }
    else{
        return seg1.eventStartMS - seg2.eventStartMS || // earlier events go first
                    seg2.eventDurationMS - seg1.eventDurationMS || // tie? longer events go first
                    seg2.event.allDay - seg1.event.allDay || // tie? put all-day events first (booleans cast to 0/1)
                    compareByFieldSpecs(seg1.event, seg2.event, this.view.eventOrderSpecs);
    }
}

<p>In this case I only want to sort event by color in the ""basicVeek"" view.
Then I have remove the eventStartMS &amp; eventDurationMS tests.</p>

FireFox
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GeJMb.jpg"" alt=""FireFox""></p>",jquery|fullcalendar,"<p>I found that chrome respects the start time.  When building the event, I simply add a second to each item in the list.  In the example, I have a resultset with each of the values for the specific date in columns.  Start is in column 0, and title is in column 1 in the resultset.</p>

<p>In my example, I do the following:</p>

<pre><code>var startVal = """";
$.each(data.ResultSet, function(row)
title = data.ResultSet[row][1];
startVal = new Date(data.ResultSet[row][0]);
startVal.setSeconds(startVal.getSeconds() + row);
start: startVal;

Hi,<br><br>
For those that keep searching for a better solution to this, now there is a new event in the version 2.4.0 of fullcalendar called <a href=""http://fullcalendar.io/docs/event_rendering/eventOrder/"" rel=""noreferrer"">eventOrder</a>.<br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, FullCalendar decides that events with longer durations and earlier start times are sorted above other events. However, events often have the same exact start time and duration, which is especially true for all-day events. By default, when this happens, events are sorted alphabetically by title. <strong>eventOrder provides the ability to override this behavior</strong>.</p>

I'm trying to use a java script to pull the user ID from the column ID it does pull it by using <code>document.getElementById(""uId"").innerText</code> but it just takes the first row only even if I click on other edit buttons.</p>

            $('#divContent').show().load('editUser.php');

<p><strong>Problem 2:</strong>
I also have another problem with the above code it's like this when I send data to another PHP other than the editUSer.php through the same function it doesn't get submitted but when I send to another php then echo the data it just shows up but I want to just send the ID directly to the editUser.php file and fill the current existing data in to the fields.</p>

<p>Can some help me to solve this issue.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
I tried the below answer but still the problem is there.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong>
Below code is picking up the ID but it's not getting sent to the processing php for some reason can some one tell me why?.</p>

<pre><code>var uId = $(this).data(""uid"");
// alert(uId);
$.post(""test.php?uId=""+uId,function() {
    $('#bgDimmer').hide();
    $('#divContent').load('test.php',function(){
        $(this).show();
        $('#bgDimmer').show();
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3:</strong></p>

<p><strong>SUCCESS!</strong> I managed solve the problem below is the description what happened and how I solved it.</p>

<p>So this what was happening with the code I posted above as you can see I was trying to send just one value to a page called editUser.php which will capture that and use it to get details from that data base and file the fields of the user editing form.</p>

<p>But it was not working I use @mplungjan's code but still nothing. When the form get loaded there was no data sent from the main button click event. I was echoing the sent value in editUser.php.</p>

<p>After almost pulling my hair out I looked at the browser console specially the network tab. Oh my god there were 2 instances where on looked like this <a href=""http://editUser.php?uId=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://editUser.php?uId=1</a> and the other <a href=""http://editUser.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://editUser.php</a>.</p>

<p>Actually what was happening is the first one sent the data but second one loaded in with no data which was called by the <code>'#divContent').load('editUser.php'</code> which led to the error undefined index due to there was no data to be captured.</p>

<p>Well the solution was simple and my logic was flawed (human error - Yey, I'm still human). What I've to do is to send the data via the same command which loaded the page. I still have a small code part from @mplungjan's code but rest is mine below is the solution which made it work.</p>

<pre><code>$('.uEdit').click(function (){
    var uId = $(this).data(""uid"");       

      $('#bgDimmer').show();
      $('#divContent').show().load('editUser.php?uId='+uId);
   });
});

</code></pre>",javascript|jquery|html|css,"<p><strong>EDIT</strong><br></p>

<p>I worked a little more on your animation.<br>
Yes, the <code>intervals</code> were a problem.</p>

<p>So I complicated the code a little... To make it more simple!!! (lol)</p>

<p>I have set an <code>interval</code> which sets 6 <code>timeouts</code>.<br>
The <code>setTimeouts</code> only add the animation class, which I call <code>.animateD</code>... And adjust the z-indexes.</p>

<p>And I no longer use the <code>animation-play-state</code>.</p>

<p>So on <code>mouseleave</code>, you can clear all <code>timeouts</code> and the <code>interval</code> in order to ""reset"" the animation to initial state. Then on mouseenter, restart the <code>interval</code>.</p>

<strong>First answer</strong><br></p>

<p>When user opens or clicks on another tab...<br>
The mouse left the <code>body</code>.</p>

<p>I think it could be the rigth moment to pause the animation.<br>
And resume it when the mouse comes back over the <code>body</code>.</p>

43445077,How to restart css animation when user opens a new tab or is inactive in the website,"<p>I have css animation that are set on an interval to show themselves and preform when a certain time has passed. It works perfectly when you are on the website however, when you leave the website and open a new tab and come back after a couple seconds, the animation seems to restart and all the circles start all at once. </p>

<p>For my question, I am asking how do you set the circles to restart when the user opens a new tab and come back. Just open the <em>codepen</em> I will have below, open a new tab, and come back after a couple seconds and you will see the circles start all together. My code will be posted below. </p>

43445077,How to restart css animation when user opens a new tab or is inactive in the website,"<p>I have css animation that are set on an interval to show themselves and preform when a certain time has passed. It works perfectly when you are on the website however, when you leave the website and open a new tab and come back after a couple seconds, the animation seems to restart and all the circles start all at once. </p>

<p>For my question, I am asking how do you set the circles to restart when the user opens a new tab and come back. Just open the <em>codepen</em> I will have below, open a new tab, and come back after a couple seconds and you will see the circles start all together. My code will be posted below. </p>

</code></pre>",javascript|jquery|html|css,"<p>Well after long months of figuring it out I finally fixed it.<br>
The problem was the Query setInterval function.</p>

<p>So I just removed it and made a ""animation-delay"", and other functions, in my css for all the circles.<br>
And now it works perfectly.</p>

<p>I believe the setInterval was making it restart when you leave the tab so the css fixed it.<br>
I will add the code for others who might come across this problem.</p>

A website automatically modifying the client's clipboard without the aid of active-x components is a security concern. Note that active-x components are programs that run on the user's machine and, technically, require the user's consent to be installed. Considering that the Clipboard is an operating system component, be happy that web browsers don't allow websites to highjack it by default.</p>

<p>If the user does not have Flash, has Flash disabled, or has active-x disabled, then he or she probably is paranoid about security and doesn't want you messing with his or her keyboard anyway. At that point, the user would be used to not having much automatic or script-based functionality in websites. It's best to not try to openly defy the wishes of the end user.</p>

<p>Set the CopyString() function to a click event on whatever you're looking to fire the event. This is available to be used on both mobile and desktop operating systems.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

<p>You need to have two different ways of going about selecting the string to copy because as of today, the method for doing so via desktop will not work for mobile devices. I have an if then function to catch if the desktop method worked and if not, to fire the code that will work for a mobile device. This method requires no downloads or links needed. Both methods highlight the text you're looking to copy then fires the copy command to your clipboard, being followed by un-selecting the string you're attempting to copy. You can mix up the code to your liking but this is the way of doing so.</p>",1
49918642,Kendo UI Combobox doesn't trigger read when dropdown arrow is clicked,"<p>I have a Kendo UI ComboBox with serverfiltering set to true and autobind to false. I want it to behave like the following:</p>

<p>1) On page load doesn't load anything.</p>

<p>2) When the user writes some text, server filtering is performed and results are displayed. </p>

<p>3) When the user click dropdown, load all items regardless of filtering and display them.</p>

<p>The issue is that in earlier versions of KendoUI, the combobox worked like the above with the right configuration, but in newer versions, entering some text and clicking on the dropdown does not trigger a read and thus only show items matching the filter.</p>

<p><strong>Reproduce</strong></p>

<p>See the following example: <a href=""https://dojo.telerik.com/ATEWEmuz"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://dojo.telerik.com/ATEWEmuz</a></p>

<p>1) Select newest version of the Kendo UI framework at ""Choose Library""</p>

<p>2) Click the combobox</p>

<p>3) Write j and wait a bit, then click outside the combobox</p>

<p>4) Click the dropdown arrow</p>

<p><em>Result in earlier versions vs result in current version:</em></p>

<p>Is there a way to tell kendo to reload all data when I click on dropdown via configuration? I tried binding the ondown event on the arrow to a datasource read command, but that resulted in other weird behavior.</p>",javascript|jquery|kendo-ui,"<p>If you log the read actions</p>

<pre><code>var ret = [""John"", ""Candice"", ""Scott"", ""Rejer""];
console.log(ret);
console.log(filter);

<p>You will see that older libraries read with no filter during open event.  The newest library does not perform a read during open.</p>

    setTimeout(function(){
        $(""#foo"").addClass(o);
    }, i * 2000 );
});​​​​​​​​
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the first effect will run immediately since <code>i</code> is equal to the index of <code>0</code>, meaning the timeout happens instantly. If you want this to be delayed, you can increment <code>i</code> as you see fit before multiplying by 2000.</p>

<p>I need to clone a table dynamically onclick. but then I need to change the ids of the table and its child elements each time. as the table can have lots of children it will be to difficult to do this manually. I need a way to change the id's of all child(all descendants) elements. I will always just add the counter to the id. (I know children will access only the immediate children but I just wanted to try if that works). If you guys know how this can be done in either jQuery or Javascript, please let me know.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table id=""table""&gt; 
    &lt;tr id = ""tr"" &gt; 
        &lt;td id=""td""&gt; 
            &lt;span id=""span"" value=""hiii""&gt;hi&lt;/span&gt;

        table.appendTo(""#table"") 
        alert(document.getElementById(""tr1"")) 
        alert(document.getElementById(""span1"").value) 
    }); 
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>",jquery,"<p>If <code>elem</code> is the parent of your cloned structure and <code>cntr</code> is the counter you said you were maintaining, you can fix all ids in that cloned structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>function fixIds(elem, cntr) {
    $(elem).find(""[id]"").add(elem).each(function() {
        this.id = this.id + cntr;
    })
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the ids might already have a cloned number at the end and you want to replace that number, you can do so like this:</p>

<pre><code>function fixIds(elem, cntr) {
    $(elem).find(""[id]"").add(elem).each(function() {
        this.id = this.id.replace(/\d+$/, """") + cntr;

<p>So, based on the code you've now added to your question, you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt; 
    var cloneCntr = 1;
    $(""button"").click(function () { 
        var table = $(""#table"").clone(true,true)

        table.insertAfter(""#table"") 
        cloneCntr++;
    });

<hr>

<p>If you are just trying to add a row, then you need to clone the row, not the whole table.</p>

<p>You could add a cloned row to the existing table with this code:</p>

<pre><code>function fixIds(elem, cntr) {
    $(elem).find(""[id]"").add(elem).each(function() {
        this.id = this.id.replace(/\d+$/, """") + cntr;
    })
}
var cloneCntr = 1;
$(""button"").click(function () {

    fixIds(row, cloneCntr++);
    row.appendTo(""#table"")

</blockquote>

<p>I don't think this is ugly.</p>

<p>The key to this problem is functional scoping.  Let me show you what I mean.  You need to create a function that is called before you send your XHR call.  In your case, you're doing it with a click event, so let me show you an example tailored for you:</p>

<pre><code>$( '#somelink' ).click( function( )
{
    // this stores the location of the current ""this"" value
    // into this function, and will available even after we
    // end this function (and will still live while the XHR's
    // callback is being executed

    var theLink = this;

    // fire the AJAX call

    $.post
    (
        'some/url',

        { 'some':'data' }, // optional

        function( )
        {
            // use theLink however you want
            // it'll still be there

            // also, if you're sending in callbacks
            // as variables, you can safely say

            hideAndStore.call( theLink, data );

            // which executes callback( ), overriding
            // ""this"" with theLink (your DOM node)
            // and sending in the responseText as the
            // first argument
        }
    );
} );
</code></pre>

<p>and then you could make your callback something like:</p>

<pre><code>function hideAndStore( response )
{
    // you can safely use ""this"" as the DOM node
    $( this ).css( { 'display':'none' } );

    // and you can do whatever you wish with the response
    window.globalData = response;
}
</code></pre>

<p>where you'd make it do whatever you actually want it to do, haha.</p>

<p>I've found some webkit-specific samples, but I'm battling to find any decent code samples that even work at all in Firefox 3.6</p>

<p>For a sample, I'd be happy with something that works with the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Our company uses jquery extensively so I'd prefer samples that use that library or pure javascript.</li>
<li>It should at least work on firefox (3.6+ is fine) </li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone point me to some links that provide some guidance and code samples?</p>",jquery|html5,"<p>Knowing offline storage is supported by all the major browsers now, I put up a jQuery plugin for handling form state. <a href=""http://www.jasonsebring.com/dumbFormState"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jasonsebring.com/dumbFormState</a> and the source is small and easy to understand. </p>

<p>I recommend the approach to do serialization using Douglas Crockford's JSON2.stringify :
<a href=""https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js</a>  to take an object in JavaScript and turn it into a JSON string. Then you can save that to either window.sessionStorage or window.localStorage easily like so:   </p>

<p>// setting data</p>

<p>window.sessionStorage['mydata'] = JSON.stringify(someObject);</p>

<p>// getting it back</p>

<p>someObject = jQuery.parseJSON(window.sessionStorage['mydata']);</p>

<p>Another thing to think about is namespacing your keys. For what I was doing, I wanted it automatic so key names were saved based off 'dumbFormState-' + window.location.pathname + 
'-' + form index to ensure the keys were automatically unique then you could loop through them later do delete them by checking the prefix 'dumbFormState-' matching they keys as you don't want to delete any other stuff on there that people may use.</p>

<p>Hope that helps a bit.</p>",0

20622241,"animations of multiple widths simultaneously, amounting to 100%","<p>I am trying to adjust the widths of two elements to expand to a wider area when a user closes a left panel. 
To do this I animate the left panel to right: 100%, and expand the first element to take over more area while keeping the second element with a fixed width (which also is an animation since now the whole div takes up more space so his percentage needs to change in order for it to take up the same pixel width)</p>

<p>The code is rather long so I won't post much of it here, stack overflow requires something so here's how I do the width animations:</p>

<pre><code>  $('#centerWeb').animate({
                ""width"": ""81.33333333%""
        }, {
            duration: 1000,

<p>JSFiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/dpPG7/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/dpPG7/</a></p>

<p>I have several problems, the first, the animation isn't 'smooth', it's fidgety, I've heard or people saying that you can use the same timer queue for queuing animations but I couldn't find how (since I believed that small differences in percentages might cause this). 
Any ideas anyone could help with?</p>

<p>My second problem is that sometimes, like in the jsfiddle example, one of the center elements bounces down a row. In my complete web this happens when re-expanding the left area however in the JSfiddle example it happens when minimizing the left area.</p>

<p>In the JSFiddle: The left area when clicked removes it and expands the rest, and the red button when clicked expands the left area back.</p>

<p>My third and final problem, the animation of the left area, when expanding it back, doesn't occur at the same time as the expansion of the first center area (the actionList), it occurs once it's finished, despite being queue:false.</p>",javascript|jquery|html|css|animation,"<p>As I commented, I personally prefer <a href=""http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ImznC"" rel=""nofollow"">this codepen example</a>:</p>

This way, the DOM object points to the swipebox object (via the <code>.data()</code> association) and the swipebox object contains the relevant DOM object so each can get to the other as needed.</p>",1

That happens when you change an attribute that influences the layout (ex: width) and then immediately ask for information about the layout.

            }); //end .submit()
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally here is my Guider Model:</p>

<pre><code>public class Guider
    {
        [Key]
        [ForeignKey(""ApplicationUser"")]
        public string GuiderID { get; set; }
        //code...
        public double? Latitude { get; set; }
        public double? Longitude { get; set; }
        public bool IsAccepted { get; set; }

        [ForeignKey(""CancellationPolicy"")]
        public int? CancellationPolicyID { get; set; }

        [ForeignKey(""Premium"")]
        public int? PremiumID { get; set; }

        public virtual Premium Premium { get; set; }
        public virtual CancellationPolicy CancellationPolicy { get; set; }
        public virtual ApplicationUser ApplicationUser { get; set; }

        public virtual ICollection&lt;UnavailableDate&gt; UnavailableDates { get; set; }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>Well the problem was that whenever I was trying to return List of Guider nothing was happening and event of error function of ajax was raising. So I tried to return just an Object of Guider and evrything was working perfectly.
This controller is working perfetcly:</p>

<pre><code>[HttpGet]
        public JsonResult ShowGuiders(string latitude, string longitude)
        {

            myGuider.Country = ""Greece"";
            return Json(myGuider, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);

        }
</code></pre>

<p>So I figured out that Json does not suport my object hierarchy. So I solved my problem with anononymus objects. I modified the controller like this, and I return propperties that I need :</p>

<pre><code>[HttpGet]
        public JsonResult ShowGuiders(string latitude, string longitude)
        {
            double lat = DataTypeConvert.ConvertToDouble(latitude);
            double lon = DataTypeConvert.ConvertToDouble(longitude);
            GeoCoordinate geoCoordinateFrom = new GeoCoordinate(lat, lon);

            var nearbyGuiders = (from guider in db.Guiders.AsEnumerable()
                                 let distance = geoCoordinateFrom.GetDistanceTo(new GeoCoordinate(guider.Latitude.Value, guider.Longitude.Value))
                                 where distance &lt;= 100000
                                 orderby distance ascending
                                 select new { country = guider.Country } ).ToList();
            return Json(nearbyGuiders, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);

        }
